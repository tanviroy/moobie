# Moobie üé¨üîç
#### Date of completion: 19th June 2020

## Description
Moobie is a Movie Finding Web App created using the [Open Movie Database (OMDb) API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). This is a project I made primarily to understand how APIs work and practice a few other things I already knew. I'm yet to deploy this successfully but you can clone/download the repo to use it.

## Key Learnings
* Learning about APIs and using one 
* JSON
* Realising logo designing is definitely not my thing :P

## Acknowledgments
I would like to credit my really cool CS Professor Debayan Gupta (again) for being the reason behind my interest in CS. 
I would also like to thank my best friend "smol gurl" for being my biggest inspiration.
